My first Swift iOS app - Code School tutorial

### Requirements
Using XCode Version 7.2.1
iPhone Simulator: iPhone 6s

### Description
This is a simple app to practice iOS programming with Swift. The app has three 'scenes': an About Me page, a Product page, and a Table (list view) page. The Table page lists all the products, each can be selected to go to that product's page. The app has not been deployed - use Xcode's iPhone simulator to check it out.
